I liked quote by [Astra Tikas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/astratikas/) (targeted towards individual presenters). I think it summarizes AI ecosystem well :D

	"You are not special"
	"No, you are special, all of you are special"

## Panel discussion on "Green Tech through AI"

[Kristjan JÃ¤rvi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristjan-jarvi-b0412ab3/)
- Subjectivity
- understanding of yourself from inside
- AI increasing yourself
- Creating a whole world

	- "Twilight senses" project
	- agentic self

**AI OBJECTIVITY**

[Priit Lepasepp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/priit-lepasepp/)
+ old power plants
+ energy efficiency
+ how to consume electricity in the future
+ wanting everything now
	+ its not possible
	+ fixed agreement? bullshit bingo
	+ PV does not work, wind not always blowing, infrastructure as a grid
+ Sunly
	+ 4 markets
	+ 300 people
+ Regulation is complicated
+ Electrical engineering, renewables popular in women
	+ men want to burn stuff :D
+ AI
	+ data is there
	+ explain how it did it
	+ Estonian electricity does not make sense
	+ Narva burning stuff
	+ EVs
+ Sustainability
+ Microsoft + Nuclear
+ Battery storage
+ Desynchronization
+ Google - efficient at energy

[KÃ¼lli Vunk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kullivunk/), Head of Data Services @**Helmes**
Question: on hype and SMBs

- spending R&Ds
	- how and why
- experienced in TelCo
	- forerunners
	- legacy infra
- competitors
- underutilized universities - lots of resources, smart people

[Pilleriin Laanemets](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pilleriin-laanemets-52884a248/), Board MemberÂ **@Dremester**
Question: on circular economy how is AI helping

- some companies applied AI in transition
- its always about the price
- sustainability docs
- ESG params
- competitive
- outcome from env perspective & economic perspective - pays off
- scalable model
- impact is bigger

KÃ¼lli - have you created any cool projects (at Helmes)
- companies need to do digitalization first
- then basic prediction models
- including in circular economy
- e-commerce. return problem.
- analytics platforms
	- reporting
	- prediction model
	- training
	- weather forecasts
	- potentials
- What if software could have energy efficiency could have
- Advices
	- Cost optimization
	- Healthtech - have money
	- Fintech - have money
	- VC funds -> B2B companies
	- AI infra

### Question: AI climate impact goals in Estonia?

Priit:
- we are so small
- central Europe -> US or Asia
- we (estonians) are storytellers
- cleantech 80% of funding is energy
	- how much metal is in Estonia
	- how much electricity can I put through it?
	- AI understands it
	- here (in Estonia) grids are not privately held, US has private grids
	- you can hypothetically find who/what kills nature, and fix that

Kristjan:
- where energy starts from?
	- you
- fear of missing out.
- where do you put your resources
- efficiency, cost less
- vs 
- change own understanding / mindset
	- what people want from life
	- not to deal with problems
	- male / female energy is out of balance, need more female energy
- Avatar movie; we are all native to this Earth
- ying yang work again
- how can AI help?
	- AI is the main tool
	- psychiatrist
	- sing and dance
- Estonia gifting Earth
- People recognize ourselves
	- Elon Musk - we are in a simulation
	- its the AI that we are

Vattan:
- AI empowering people
	- having world knowledge in your hand
	- be faster

### Question: What are you excited about

Pilleriin:
- Prevention
	- ML models of circular economy preventing
	- resource efficiency
	- competitive

KÃ¼lli:
- bringing knowledge & accessibility
- individuals using AI in broad

Kristjan:
- self empowerment not as much as self awareness
	- slowdive
	- frequency zones
	- holistic healing
	- future medicine
	- sounds

Priit:
- electricity & efficiency

### Question is AI a "car"?
- audience: more like a conveyer belt
- automation and digitalization
- AI act


Astra:
- Scared about sustainability
- Agents
- what future will look like with agents?
- human in a loop
- take care of us
- can we solve it for the future? that agents can consume but people not? (not social interference?)

Priit:
- hope not
- for engineering mindset
- logical to have wife made up
- physical contact
- billion company
- but not alone

Kristjan:
- edgy but comfort zone
- lets go play. best stuff there
- depends on a person and mindset
- everything is a manipulation
- raise awareness
- part of evolution


# My questions ðŸ’­
+ To Kristjan **on AI objectivity**
+ To Priit
	+ **on constant Energy supply, Fusion** and Nuclear
	+ feels like we are creating artificial scarcity
- To KÃ¼lli - examples of circular economy projects
- To KÃ¼lli - isn't needed infrastructure for the software sufficient for estimating the climate impact?
