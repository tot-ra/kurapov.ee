Here is a summary of the panel "AGI: Beyond the Hype, Before the Storm", listing the most important ideas grouped by person
Disclamer: recorded with superwhisper, summarized by gemini, correctness not guaranteed

**Gert Jervan, Dean, TalTech University**
- AI/AGI is expected to have a major positive impact on the educational sector, enabling individualized learning and improving the process.
- AGI presents both challenges (powerful tools) and opportunities (directing beneficial processes).
- Estonia has a significant opportunity due to its high level of digitalization, data availability, small size allowing for experiments/demonstrators, and an established IT sector
- TalTech is launching an AI Systems program to train AI engineers, contributing to the necessary workforce that can use, understand, and develop AI.
- The role of teachers will evolve into mentors or reflectors, focusing on educating students to think rather than just recall facts.
- AI should be viewed as an important tool.

**Andre Visse, CEO, Telia Eesti**
- For infrastructure companies/vital service providers, AI/AGI brings significant risks that need to be addressed alongside opportunities.
- Infrastructure needs to support autonomous systems, which raises questions about investment, scaling, and who will pay for these capabilities.
- Automation, while beneficial, introduces complexity in troubleshooting and maintenance compared to human error (illustrated by network script incidents).
- There is a challenge in determining the safe level of autonomy for critical infrastructure and how to keep humans effectively in the loop for oversight and intervention.
- EU regulations (like the AI Act) can sometimes be slow, potentially hindering progress compared to other regions.
- AI is a tool, but users must remain in control and be aware that it can sometimes present misinformation or "hypnotize" users into believing its output. It does not "think" or have personality.
    

**Taivo Pungas, CTO, Pactum**
- Based on practical experience, it feels like "jagged AGI" already exists – superhuman in specific tasks but useless for basic physical tasks.
- Provides personal examples of using AI for complex research, meeting preparation, scripting, and evaluating purchasing decisions, highlighting its current usefulness.
- As intelligence becomes cheap and abundant, the compliments to AI become more valuable (basic economic principle).
- Key complements to AI include soft skills, agency (AI won't initiate projects), selecting the right problems/tasks, discerning usefulness, general management, and providing clear instructions/goals.
- Robot dexterity is currently limited.

**Vattan**
- AI "agents" follow protocols, use loops, and leverage external APIs (or "MCP") to access information beyond their training data.
- AGI can be viewed as a potential business model.
- Estonia needs an "AI Mafia" (influential network) willing to support young talent and entrepreneurs to foster breakthrough innovation.
- Direct funding for AI research and development is needed, not just bundled under other sectors.
- Significant opportunities for Estonia lie in AI security (needed as AI grows) and E-governance (AI requires governance, and Estonia has an advantage here).
- Training skilled AI/ML engineers is a difficult and time-consuming process.
- Suggests building a federated/predicted learning layer on top of Estonia's X-Road system (e.g., for health data) as a concrete innovation opportunity.

**Lembit Loo**
- The exact definition of AGI is less important than the fact that we are approaching significant capabilities ("at the finish line").
- Estonia needs to figure out how to effectively utilize the AGI wave through cooperation and partnerships.
- Estonia has a unique position: capable of understanding/using technology (like the US and China) while also being part of the EU regulatory framework (like the AI Act).
