title: "Product team models - project based, feature factory and product operating model"
---
Listened to the podcast
https://www.tpg.ee/p/product-team-models-project-based

Was interesting to listen and reflect how organizations tend to have indeed different structures. I suppose the project-based is a tendency in small and outsourcing companies, while more mature product-orinented companies go with feature-factories. I don't think I've seen a good implementation of the described product operating model myself. It seems hard to do such a company-wise mindset shift because people are narrow-focused on their role and thinking outside the box requires jumping through multiple layers. Even if companies are matrix-shaped and have vertical teams, they are not representing all layers. For example sales, marketing, support and infrastructure likely won't be part of the the team. 

So I do wonder how does [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAY2INMBWEFb2DGIN_C90g7kFrUNleyMCAE)[Aive Uus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aive-uus/) break those mindsets ðŸ˜„ Hopefully we'll see more of this
