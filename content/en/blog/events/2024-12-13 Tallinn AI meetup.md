Another day, another AI meetup 😀  
Apparently now there is a dedicated TallinnAI meetup ([https://lnkd.in/dPG-AzpP](https://lnkd.in/dPG-AzpP)), hopefully it can become a recurring one  
  
First talk by [Andrei Sbitnev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrei-sbitnev-a6995811a/) was about [https://figurix.com/](https://figurix.com/) and 3d model generation using AI. Specifically, given a photo, generate a cartoon-like 3d avatar with animation. Uses ComfyUI https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI and [https://www.tripo3d.ai/](https://www.tripo3d.ai/) under the hood. I liked the lean mindset of using home server to run this (I'm at similar phase of bee detections).  
  
I also like visual workflows and [Clarifai](https://www.linkedin.com/company/clarifai/) has workflows as a major feature. I was wondering if open-source has sufficiently advanced capabilities like streaming and video support. Workflows can become hard to manage if there are too many node types as combinatorics grows and you need to know what use-cases are compatible. It becomes a programming language quite fast.  
  
Second talk was by [Mikhail Dunaev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikhail-dunaev/) on [https://www.hexagen.world/](https://www.hexagen.world/) . An infinite canvas project with hexagonal ai-generated tiles that make up a cool map that over 8 thousand users tried out. Most of it coded also using cursor, making author 2x more efficient, shifting work into more product-oriented thinking.

I hope this project gets some revenue flow and develops some more features:  
- zoom in with upscale  
- 3d map of the tiles for navigation  
- animation  
- large-scale context to have more global terrain features like rivers and mountains affecting the generated tiles  
- some sort of interactivity (exploring as a character, or maybe some sort of cross-tile interactions).. but it may go out of art into actual game at this point![](/ru/blog/события/img/1734115097486.jpg)
