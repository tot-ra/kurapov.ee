[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAATpyCYBNvTwrXbpyTzIbbsww6RGFgAqXfs)[Jaroslav Judin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaroslavjudin/) expanded on prior credit-card anti-fraud talk that [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABOtRMkBl5GVjNulXmUgn5Xp35BRy3kyqx8)[Elizaveta Lebedeva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizaveta-lebedeva/) did. This time focus was on redis. Sandbox - [https://lnkd.in/d78gmwZm](https://lnkd.in/d78gmwZm)  
  
Swedbank talk by [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAC9rk-cBmz6tHVVW51iOplqkfSCUaBOinAQ)[Lehar Oha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lehar-oha-8875301a2/) & [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAin2SgB0uwWuZhgFvq0WQoYVN_4UOhjSKg)[Markus Reimegård](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-reimeg%C3%A5rd-12077240/) was somewhat high-level about adding AI (similar to what [Clarifai](https://www.linkedin.com/company/clarifai/) does as a service). As I understood, pdf parsing for RAG might be hard, just to get right embeddings. But I hope I will be able to ask Swedbank GPT about my contracts (leasing or insurance) for preliminary analysis. Just add a notice that it's an automated tool doing an analysis.  
  
[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAuBdeYBCCG1ozalq02R1vihAokubt-VyYc)[Dmytro Hnatiuk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhnatiuk/) talked about databases. The insight there as I understood is that its similar to Security. If you have DB not performing well, its not that much of DB engineer problem, its developer's problem. Developers need to think in advance about storage, queries, sharding, domain separation, archival etc.  
  
[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAADPh0UBL4Tr5XwVo2W1ggVRbQmBrl3SUWs)[Arne Ansper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arne-ansper/) was advocating for UML and state machines. I sort of like to document high-level things with mermaidjs, but at times I question if UML is that intuitive (and that you should not reinvent new modelling language), if it needs to be source of truth with code generation or that one needs to first model the system with RUP

[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAB4CF88BWmFkjSEw6UcAjqwKreUN9WgoeHo)[Eddy Vinck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddyvinck/) was promoting Astro [https://astro.build/](https://astro.build/) - a javascript framework to generate static websites with some extensions. I was thinking of migrating my blog and merging it with second-brain data from notion/obsidian and publishing that as a static website to have less CMS/DB management overhead. Maybe this static generation would help, but I'm worried about search, including vector search for recomendations.
